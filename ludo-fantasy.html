      <h2>Contextual Intro</h2>
      <p>
        During my time supporting the delivery team on <em>Ludo Fantasy</em>, I stepped into a hybrid BA role—mapping user journeys, reviewing early telemetry patterns, and helping clarify product requirements around onboarding and match entry. Although the data here is anonymized and simplified, the problems and decision-making reflect how I contributed to improving the early funnel experience.

      <h2>End-to-End Approach</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Discovery</strong> — Audited onboarding flow, reviewed common user issues, mapped the “install → first match” journey.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem Identification</strong> — Flagged unclear wallet/KYC messaging and inconsistent match availability indicators.</li>
        <li><strong>Requirements Clarification</strong> — Documented simplified flows and clarified CTAs with PM and devs.</li>
        <li><strong>Design Collaboration</strong> — Supported design in creating clearer entry paths and improvement concepts.</li>
        <li><strong>Build Support</strong> — Validated events in test builds and logged defects tied to onboarding.</li>
        <li><strong>Review & Recommendations</strong> — Summarized friction points and aligned improvements for the next sprint cycles.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="case-block">
      <h2>Key Findings & Recommendations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>New players preferred a direct “Quick Match” path instead of multi-step onboarding prompts.</li>
        <li>Wallet/KYC steps felt overwhelming on first open; deferring non-critical instructions reduced hesitation.</li>
        <li>Room availability indicators needed to reflect real-time status to prevent user confusion.</li>
        <li>Consistent terminology across onboarding and lobby screens reduced back-navigation and drop-offs.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="case-block">
      <h2>Impact & Results</h2>
      <p>
        While no sensitive metrics are shared, the streamlined flows and clearer onboarding guidance enabled the team to reduce early friction, improve the perceived clarity of the first-time user path, and establish a more structured KPI framework for future decision-making.
